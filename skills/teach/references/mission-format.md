# MISSION.md Format

`MISSION.md` lives at the workspace root. It captures the *reason* the user is
learning this topic. Every teaching decision -- what to teach next, which
resources to surface, which exercises to design -- should trace back to it.

## Template

```md
# Mission: {Topic}

## Why
{1-3 sentences. The concrete real-world goal the user is chasing. What changes
in their life or work when they have this skill? Avoid abstract framings like
"to understand X" -- push for the underlying outcome.}

## Success looks like
- {A specific, observable thing the user will be able to do}
- {Another specific thing}

## Constraints
- {Time, budget, prior commitments, learning preferences -- anything that bounds
  the approach}

## Out of scope
- {Adjacent topics the user explicitly does not want to chase right now --
  protects the zone of proximal development}
```

## Rules

- **One mission per workspace.** Two unrelated goals means two workspaces.
- **Concrete over abstract.** "Run a half marathon by October" beats "get
  fitter." "Ship a Rust CLI to my team" beats "learn Rust."
- **Push back on vagueness.** If the user cannot articulate why, interview them
  via `AskQuestion` before writing anything. A bad mission is worse than none.
- **Revise when reality shifts.** When the user's goal moves, update this file
  -- don't leave a stale mission steering future sessions.
- **Keep it short.** If `MISSION.md` runs past a screen, it has stopped being a
  compass and started being a plan.
